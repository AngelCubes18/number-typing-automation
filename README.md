Functionality    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•The user types a range of numbers, e.g. (1000 to 100000) and then the script types for the user in a input box and presses enter.

• By dafault the second input of sleep has more weight on the randomness.

• Ask if you want a sleep between the numbers.

• Ask if you want fixed digit/s so for example if user did enter from 1000 to 10000 and put fixed digit on 2 of value 5, it will do: 1200, 1201, 1202...12001, etc.



Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• Install python [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

• Run numbertypingautomation.py or numbertypingautomation_v4.exe

• Go to the app you want to program to work on

• Profit!

I've added the python script so you can see it's not a rat. This because of the executable, virus total detects false positives on the executable but not on the python script. I don't really know why, but maybe is because of the way that **nuitka** compiles the programs.
Here you can see the comparisons:
