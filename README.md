Functionality    
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The user types a range of numbers, e.g. (1000 to 100000) and then the script types for the user in a input box and presses enter.
• Does a sleep between the numbers.

• By dafault the second input of sleep has more weight on the randomness.

• Does a fixed digits so for example if user did enter from 1000 to 10000 and put fixed digit on 2 of value 5, it will do: 1200, 1201, 1202...12001, etc.
